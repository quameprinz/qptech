<p1> You know that "save/reload dance" we've been doing for years? The one where you make changes in your editor, hit save, switch to the browser and then refresh to finally see the result? With Brackets, you don't have to do that dance.</p1>
    

<p> Brackets will open a live connection to your local browser and push HTML and CSS updates as you type! You might already be doing something like this today with browser-based tools, but with Brackets there is no need to copy and paste the final code back into the editor. Your code runs in the browser, but lives in your editor! </p>

    <p> Mind you, this site is under construction.</p><br>
    One more thing! This is a link to Google to know more about me. <A HREF="http://www.google.com" target="blank"><em>Click Here</em></A><br>

<DIV ALIGN="left">
This is the text to be left aligned. <P> I can align lots of text with the division tag!
</DIV>
    OK now, lets check this out. You asking what? I guess so, its <strong><em>FOnt</em></strong>. I want us to discuss fontface, font size & font color. Lets take some dummy text and apply these attributes. 
    <div align= "center"> <b><font size ="5">Lyrics to kidi's <em>say cheese</em></font></b><br> <font face= "Comic Sans MS" size="4" color=""><strong><font color="aliceblue">firts verse</font></strong><br>

    <strong><font color="aliceblue">chorus</font></strong><br>
        say cheese take a picture shaka pose make i see take a pic 4x<br></font>
    </div><br>How do u feel applying these attributes? I suppose you showing a good facial expression already. Allow me to show you what more I discovered. I think you wanna know. OK, lemme tell you, its a <font face= "courier new" size="4" color="orange"><b><em>list</em></b></font>. That's what i will like to share with you.<p> Listing is a way of organising items. However, a list can be in these forms also; <ol> <li> Unordered <li>Definition List</ol> I guess u realised something from the above listing? May be yes. There was a numbering, which shows that the list is an ordered list. What of an unordered list? For that, we use the bulleting styles which has types as: circle, disc, square. Let's take some items. Errm i think is should rather take my four favorite songs of Kidi. <font face="Cooper" size="4"><em>Les go</em></font> <ul type="circle"><li> Adiepena <li> Enjoyment <li> Say Cheese <li> End In Tears</ul> <br>Now let's move to the definition list. With the definition list, it is initiated with <dl> and ends with </dl>. We take an example and see how it works. OK then, i will like us to ditinguish between "music" and "melody". <dl><dt><b><font color="darkblue">Music</font></b><dd> A sound or the study of such sounds, organized in time.<p><dt> <b><font color="darkblue">Melody</font></b><dd>
    A pleasing series of notes that form the main part of a song or piece of music.</dl> <p>
    Now lemme surprise u a little. See below <br>
